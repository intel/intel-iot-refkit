# This class can be used to generate (or import) a set of signing keys,

# the signing of base OS and flatpak ostree repositories.

# To make sure all the necessary keys get generated list them in your
# local.conf (or some other global configuration file) by setting
# REFKIT_SIGNING_KEYS to necessary key IDs.

    # When building several images in parallel (e.g. in CI), we have to

    # key into the keyring. While GPG itself seems to semi-gracefully
    # survive a keyring with duplicate key ids, gpgme (or maybe just ostree,
    # I did not bother checking it) segfaults in such a case.
    # Therefore, we have this unholy kludge where we use mkdir(2) as a
    # lock, and let the task getting there first do the deed, while the
    # second one just waits for the first to finish (and consequently causes
    # its own dependent tasks to properly wait for the keys to get generated).
