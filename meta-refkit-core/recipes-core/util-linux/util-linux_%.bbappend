# nologin can come from two separate sources, shadow and util-linux.
# Normally these do not conflict, the one from shadow goes into /sbin,
# the one from util-linux goes into /usr/sbin. With usrmerge enabled,
# however, /sbin is symlinked to /usr/sbin and these start conflicting.
# If that happens, we make util-linux get out of the way by removing
# its nologin.
#
# Ideally we probably should make sure first that shadow is enabled to
# ensure we don't end up without any /{usr/,}sbin/nologin.
