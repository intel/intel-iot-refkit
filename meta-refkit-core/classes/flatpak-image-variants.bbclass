#
# Define two flatpak-related image variants.
#
# - flatpak runtime image variant 'flatpak-runtime':
#     This variant corresponds to a flatpak BasePlatform runtime. In
#     addition to the content of its base image, this variant has the
#     necessary runtime bits for flatpak. Using this image on a device
#     enables one to pull in, update and run applications as flatpaks
#     from flatpak remotes/repositories.
#
# - flatpak SDK image variant 'flatpak-sdk':
#     This variant corresponds to a flatpak BaseSdk runtime. It has the
#     necessary bits for compiling applications and publishing them as
#     flatpaks in flatpak repositories.
#
# When building these images variants, a flatpak repository will also be
# populated with the contents of these images. This repository can be used
# to flatpak-install the runtime and SDK runtimes on a development machine
# for generating flatpaks for the flatpak-runtime image variant.

# 'flatpak-runtime' variant (runtime image for a device)
IMAGE_VARIANT[flatpak-runtime] = "flatpak"

# 'flatpak-sdk' variant (SDK image for a development host)
IMAGE_VARIANT[flatpak-sdk] = "flatpak tools-develop tools-debug dev-pkgs"
