# This class implements image creation for the refkit target.
# The image is GPT based.
# To boot, it uses a combo file, containing kernel, initramfs and
# command line, presented to the BIOS as UEFI application, by prepending
# it with the efi stub obtained from systemd-boot.
# The layout of the image is described in a separate, customizable json file.

# By default, the full image is meant to fit into 4*10^9 bytes, i.e.
# "4GB" regardless whether 1000 or 1024 is used as base. 64M are reserved
# for potential partitioning overhead.

# The image does without traditional bootloader.
# In its place, instead, it uses a single UEFI executable binary, which is
# composed by:
#   - an UEFI stub
#     The linux kernel can generate a UEFI stub, however the one from systemd-boot can fetch
#     the command line from a separate section of the EFI application, avoiding the need to
#     rebuild the kernel.
#   - the kernel
#   - the initramfs
#   There is a catch: all of these binary components must have the same word size as the BIOS:
#   either 32 or 64 bit.
