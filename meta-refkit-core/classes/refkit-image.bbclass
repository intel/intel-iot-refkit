#  Prepare the symlinks required for merged /usr at the time of rootfs creation.

# The links created in rootfs are:
#/bin --> /usr/sbin
#/sbin --> /usr/sbin
#/lib --> /usr/lib
#/lib64 --> /usr/lib64

# We cannot make these symlinks as part of 'base-files' or some other package.
# Because at rootfs creation, installation of the package(say kernel) that
# depends on these root folders/links fails, if package manager installs this
# package prior to base-files.

# These symbolic links in top level folder should present as long as
#   - kerenl tools use /lib/{module,firmware}
#   - shell scripts uses
