# As step towards full stateless IoT Reference OS Kit, we now
# treat some files in /etc as conceptually read-only (i.e. neither
# modified by the OS at runtime nor by an admin). Anything contained
# in the rootfs directories will get bundled and added or updated when
# running "swupd update".
#
# The implication is that we must keep certain files out of the rootfs
# which do get modified at runtime, because otherwise there are
# "swupd verify" failures.

# mtab needs to be a symlink to /proc/mounts, probably forever.
# There is no point in patching that out of binaries, nor is there
# a need to customize it, so the symlink can remain there as read-only
# system component.

# OE-core puts some files into /etc which systemd then later overwrites
