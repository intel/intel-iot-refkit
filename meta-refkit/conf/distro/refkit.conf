# IoT Reference OS Kit tries to build minimal images and thus prefers Busybox or
# Toybox over coreutils or any other package providing similar
# functionality. For technical reasons, this is crucial when building
# swupd bundles: Busybox/Toybox must be picked consistently, even when
# a bundle pulls in alternatives like coreutils which normally would
# have a higher priority.
#
# This gets achieved in two ways:
# 1. via refkit-update-alternatives.bbclass we modify all packages
#    so that their update-alternatives priority can be modified
#    during install time
# 2. in refkit-image.bbclass we reconfigure those priorities
#    as necessary
#
# This is still a change that is done consistently for all images,
# whether they use swupd or not, to ensure that the result is
# identical. Doing it at image creation time reduces the need
# for recompilations of packages and opens up the possibility
# for downstream developers to override the defaults while
# reusing pre-compiled binaries from our sstate.

# When building refkit-initramfs and IMA is enabled, the
# distro-specific IMA policy chosen below gets compiled into it. The
# rootfs signing has to match, therefore this is a distro setting. The
# actual policy file is in meta-refkit/files/ima_policy_refkit.
#
# By default, all files will be signed. Once IMA is active and its
# policy includes a signed file, such signed files can be removed and
# replaced, but not modified. Therefore we have to exclude certain
# read/write files from signing and instead only hash them.
#
# To find such files, boot a signed image with no_ima, then run:
# cd /
# find etc usr -type f |
# while read i; do
#    ima=$(getfattr -d -e hex -m security.ima "$i" | grep security.ima)
#    if [ $(echo $ima | wc -c) -gt 60 ] ; then
#        if evmctl ima_verify "$i" >/dev/null; then
#            echo "Signature okay: $i"
#        else
#            echo "Broken signature: $i"
#        fi
#    elif [ -n "$ima" ]; then
#        if [ $(echo $ima | cut -c18-) = $(sha1sum "$i" | cut -c0-41) ]; then
#            echo "Hash okay: $i"
#        else
#            echo "Broken hash : $i"
#        fi
#    else
#        echo "Unprotected: $i"
#    fi
# done
#
# Files which get modified during booting will show up as "broken"
# or "unprotected".
#
# At the moment, IoT Reference OS Kit sets up IMA so that everything must be either
# signed (thus becoming read-only) or hashed (writeable because the
# kernel will updated hashes). Everything under /etc, /var, /home and /usr/dbspace
# is writable. Because an attacker can downgrade a file from signed to
# hashed and set a valid hash, this example policy is *not secure*.
#
# Common pitfalls:
# - After booting without IMA, enabling IMA again may run into problems
#   because files were modified without updating the hash. This can be
#   done manually with "evmctl ima_hash <file>".
# - rootfs must be mounted with "i_version" (see ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass for
#   more information). This is done via the "rootflags" boot parameter
#   (via APPEND) because only remounting like that via fstab is problematic
#   for those files written by systemd before remounting (/etc/machine-id!).
#   In addition, ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass also adds the parameter to the rootfs
#   because otherwise systemd would remove it.
# - When image signing is disabled, we must not load the IMA policy.
#   Alternatively, we could add a refkit-initramfs-noima, but the
#   benefits of that (smaller initramfs) do not justify the downsides
#   (building becomes slower).

# The swupd update mechanism currently does not cope with user or
# group IDs that change between builds
# (https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/101). Even if it
# did, changing IDs would make the update more complicated (larger
# delta, daemons need to be restarted, etc.), so it is better to
# ensure that IDs are static.
#
# IoT Reference OS Kit uses the static uid and gid mechanism from OE-core for that
# (http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#ref-classes-useradd),
# with custom support for adding systemd sysusers in IoT Reference OS Kit's
# systemd-sysusers.bbclass.  The OE-core mechanism for that currently
# lacks support for static IDs and thus cannot be used yet
# (https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9789).
#
# Dynamically assigned IDs are detected and lead to an error during
# the build. For example, the dbus recipe creates a "messagebus"
# group. Not defining that group causes an error when parsing the
# recipe and makes it unusable, leading to the following errors
# during "bitbake dbus":
# ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES 'dbus'
# ERROR: dbus was skipped: Function failed: dbus - dbus: username messagebus does not have a static ID defined.
#
# When building images, the errors shows up as missing components
# which are required for the build, as in "bitbake refkit-image-common":
# ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'udev' (but /work/iot-ref-kit/meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/packagegroup-core-boot.bb, /work/iot-ref-kit/meta/recipes-core/initrdscripts/initramfs-framework_1.0.bb RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)
# ERROR: Required build target 'refkit-image-common' has no buildable providers.
#
# The advantage of this mechanism is the decentralized assignment of
# IDs without modifying the OS or recipes.
#
# Developers who need to add new entries should add their own mapping
# file to USERADD_UID_TABLES and/or USERADD_GID_TABLES, either in a
# derived distro config or in their local.conf. IoT Reference OS Kit reserves
# the value range < 2000.
