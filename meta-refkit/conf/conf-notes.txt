Common targets are:
    refkit-image-minimal        (when building a minimal base image)
    refkit-image-common         (when building an interactive image without 
                                 any special software, the recommended target
                                 if you are not interested in any given
                                 profile)
    refkit-image-computervision (when building an image with tools and
                                 configuration for computer vision use cases)
    refkit-image-gateway        (when building an image with tools and
                                 configuration for acting as an IoT sensor 
                                 gateway)
    refkit-image-industrial     (when building an image with tools and
                                 configuration for industrial use cases)

If you have the flatpak DISTRO_FEATURE enabled (by default it is on if you
build with refkit-config enabled), there are two additional flatpak variant
targets for each image derived from refkit-image:

    -flatpak-runtime            (image variant with flatpak support enabled)
    -flatpak-sdk                (image variant used as a flatpak BaseSdk for
                                 building flatpaks suitable to be used on the
                                 corresponding -flatpak-runtime image variant)
