Common targets are:
    refkit-image-minimal        (when building a minimal base image)
    refkit-image-common         (when building an interactive image without 
                                 any special software, the recommended target
                                 if you are not interested in any given
                                 profile)
    refkit-image-computervision (when building an image with tools and
                                 configuration for computer vision use cases)
    refkit-image-gateway        (when building an image with tools and
                                 configuration for acting as an IoT sensor 
                                 gateway)

If you enable flatpak applications (see the comments in local.conf on how to
do this), you can build two additional image variants:
    <image>-flatpak-runtime     flatpak-enabled version of <image>
    <image>-flatpak-sdk         flatpak SDK runtime (OSTree repo) for the above

You can use a -flatpak-sdk image variant on your (flatpak-enabled) host
to build flatpaks for the -flatpak-runtime image variant.
